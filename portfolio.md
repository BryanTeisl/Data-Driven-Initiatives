## Project 1: Analyzing E-commerce Sales Trends
<a id="project-1"></a>

* **Objective:** To identify key drivers of sales and provide recommendations for a 3-month marketing strategy.
* **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL, Jupyter Notebook
* **Process:**
    1.  Collected and cleaned sales data from a SQL database.
    2.  Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find trends in customer behavior and product performance.
    3.  Visualized key findings, such as sales by region and time of day.
* **Results:** Delivered a report showing that 20% of products drove 80% of revenue, leading to a shift in ad spend.

<a id="project-2"></a>

* **Objective:** To build a model that predicts which customers are at high risk of churning.
* **Tools Used:** Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas), Jupyter Notebook
* **Process:** Engineered features from user activity logs, trained several classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and validated the best-performing model.
* **Results:** The final model predicted churn with 88% accuracy, allowing the retention team to focus their efforts.

* **Objective:** To determine if a new website layout (Variant B) led to a statistically significant increase in user sign-ups.
* **Tools Used:** R, Statistics (t-tests, chi-squared)
* **Process:** Analyzed experiment data, checked for statistical significance, and presented results to the product team.
* **Results:** Found that Variant B increased sign-ups by 5.2% with 95% confidence.
